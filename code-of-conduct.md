# Code of Conduct  

## Collaboration And Communication  

1. Formal progress/task distribution meetings:  
Team members will meet weekly via Discord voice call. Additional meetings can be scheduled by team members if required. Tasks will be created and assigned during weekly meetings depending on scheduled assignments on canvas and project status. After the meeting, tasks will be recorded on GitLab. Incomplete tasks will be restructured or reassigned depending on their current progress.

2. Work meetings:  
Everyone comes together to work on their own tasks. The main goals are to encourage focused work, team chemistry and whole team solution searching.

3. GitLab Issues:  
Relevant things about the respective issues will be posted as comments to not lose any verbal/informal information.

4. Chat over IMS:  
General communication for when there is no work meeting going.

5. All meetings are mandatory. If a team member is unavailable, team members must be notified beforehand.

6. Each member will work 40 hours per week (no more no less) on the project. Team members are not expected to work on weekends, however, if the target hours worked has not been reached, members can choose to work over the weekend on their own accord.

7. Team members may be expected to work together on different tasks, this can be done efficiently via Discord (screen share can be enabled), or through visual studio live share (multiple people can edit the same code).

## Individual Contribution Tracking

All committed work is to be authored by the original creator and co-authors have to be accredited at the bottom of the commit message in the following format:  

`Co-authored-by: name <name@example.com>`.

_The committer may differ from the author to allow for cherry-picking and rebasing._ 
_(Do not forget that there is a required 2 blank lines between the commit body and the Co-authored-by list)_

## Knowledge Transfer

1. All MRs are to be reviewed by someone other than the MR owner(s). This ensures that everyone is aware of changes being merged into the master branch. 

2. All team members are to be actively involved in finding solutions for problems instead of one responsible to do extensive research on their own.

3. Team members are expected to keep up with and to submit individual assignments on time and follow lectures (through live lectures or lecture slides) according to the canvas schedule.

## How Will We Solve Conflicts? 
### Team issues
As stated before work meetings in part serve to build team chemistry, mainly by having friendly banter during work.
This serves to make everyone friendlier, but will also make it wholefully obvious if there are brewing conflicts.
If a team member notices tension they will have to bring it up during the next formal meeting so that it can be resolved in a respectful way.

### Collision of ideas
All opposing parties will explain and convince each other such that the resolution is backed by everyone.
It is expected of everyone to concede and support this resolution, if this is not the case the process has to be redone.  
Should an individual not come up with valid reasoning to be opposed but also not accept the resolution then the majority vote holds and said individual will have to concede to keep their integritity.

To prevent bias, during an active conflict, past conflicts are not allowed to be used as arguments against an individual.

## Consequences
Failure to adhere to the above rules will result in a disciplinary meeting with the rest of the team members.
